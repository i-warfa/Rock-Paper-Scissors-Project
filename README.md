# Computer Vision Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a project that uses computer vision, allowing users to play a game of rock paper-scissors with the computer.

## Milestone 1

Created and trained a machine learning model using Teachable Machine, that uses the user's webcam in order to identify whether the user is showing one of the 4 classes: rock, paper, scissors or nothing.

## Milestone 2

Installed the necessary dependencies OpenCV (to record using a webcam) Ipykernel (to run notebooks) and lastly, TensorFlow (to run the model).

## Milestone 3

Defined a function which stored the choices of the user and computer.

Defined a function which generates a random choice for the computer and compares it with the user's choice to determine the round winner

## Milestone 4

Incorporated features such as a scoreboard to display the round winner and eventually the game winner (first to 3 wins, is the victor!). A countdown to notify the user the remaining time left to choose their hand.
